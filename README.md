# Identification and description of pregnancies in All of Us

This repository contains the code and data used to identify and describe pregnancies in the All of Us Research Program. The algorithm used to identify pregnancy episodes is from Jones et al. 2023<sup>1</sup>, available in [this repository](https://github.com/jonessarae/n3c_pregnancy_cohort). The code was translated into R and adapted to work on the All of Us Researcher Workbench with some small modifications.

A paper describing this work can be found here:

Smith, Louisa H, Wanjiang Wang, Brianna Keefe-Oates. "Pregnancy episodes in All of Us: harnessing multi-source data for pregnancy-related research." Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 31, no. 12 (December 2024): 2789â€“2799. https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocae195

## Warning

In the latest version of the All of Us data (V8), "perinatal" related codes are suppressed. A list of suppressed codes is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPMzOod784PAR0RfjuDezoT15z7w1e0RZsMVlpT2378/edit?gid=168982584#gid=168982584. Unfortunately, this makes this algorithm essentially useless, and pregnancy-related research impossible.

## Code

The repository is organized as follows:

- `code/`: R code to identify pregnancies and describe the cohort. These are in the form of quarto files. `01-run-hipps.qmd` contains the code to run the algorithm; the rest of the files just look at the results in various ways. These are rendered as html files, so the easiest way to view them is to follow these links:

- `code/algorithm`: Jones et al.<sup>1</sup> algorithm translated to R and adapted to work on the All of Us Researcher Workbench
- `data/`: concept sets from Jones et al.<sup>1</sup> and national vital statistics data from CDC Wonder<sup>2</sup>
- `results/`: tables/figures/other results that do not contain individual-level data

The code creates datasets with individual-level data and saves them to `workbench/`, a directory that remains on the All of Us Researcher Workbench for privacy protection.
